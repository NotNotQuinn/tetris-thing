This is a project made with greenfoot, I made it for school.
I thought it would be nice to upload.

I made this as a group project with a friend. Therefor I cannot rightfully license out this code without his permission.
However, all code that can be deemed "made by me" is under the MIT license below. I basically made the whole thing. Including art.
All images in the `images` folder are licensed under Creative Commons "BY-SA" license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/

If you would like to use this for your own school project, just remember you won't learn nearly as much as if you made it yourself.
If you are aware of this, then go ahead.
